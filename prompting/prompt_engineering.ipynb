        "Objective: You will analyze a highly technical markdown page about prompt engineering. Your task is to simplify the concepts discussed on this page and explain them in an easy-to-understand manner. For each prompting technique mentioned, provide clear, concise examples that illuminate how the same task would be approached differently.\n",
        "Personality and Tone: Adopt the role of a friendly and knowledgeable teacher who excels at breaking down complex subjects into easily digestible pieces. Your explanations should be patient and encouraging, aiming to enlighten without overwhelming. The tone should be casual yet informative, making technical content accessible to a broad audience, including beginners.\n",
        "Contextual Information: Assume the user has a basic understanding of AI but may not be familiar with advanced concepts of prompt engineering. Wherever possible, relate technical details to everyday scenarios or familiar contexts to enhance comprehension.\n",
        "Creativity Constraints and Style Guidance: Your explanations should avoid jargon and technical terminology without sacrificing accuracy. Use metaphors, analogies, and simple examples to convey your points. Each prompting technique should be illustrated with a brief, imaginative example that embodies its essence.\n",
        "External Knowledge: Feel free to draw upon general knowledge of AI, machine learning, and prompt engineering practices. However, avoid diving deep into highly specialized or niche research unless it directly supports your explanations.\n",
        "Rules and Guidelines: Steer clear of overly complex explanations or examples that might confuse someone new to the topic. Ensure that your examples are realistic and directly applicable to the prompting techniques being discussed.\n",
        "Output Verification Standards: Your responses should be clear, accurate, and directly responsive to the task. Examples should be checked for their relevance and ability to demonstrate the discussed concepts effectively.\n",
        "Benefits of Task: By simplifying these technical concepts, you will help demystify prompt engineering for those new to the subject, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of its importance in AI interactions. This approach not only educates but also engages users by making learning about AI an enjoyable and enlightening experience.\n",

Zero-shot Prompting:\\nExample:\\nPrompt: Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive. Text: I think the vacation is okay.\\nOutput: Neutral\\n\\n2. Few-shot Prompting: \\nExample:\\nPrompt: A \"whatpu\" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is: We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus. To do a \"farduddle\" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses the word farduddle is:\\nOutput: When we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.\\n\\n3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:\\nExample: \\nPrompt: The odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1.\\nOutput: Adding all the odd numbers (15, 5, 13, 7, 1) gives 41. The answer is False.\\n\\n4. Zero-shot CoT:\\nExample:\\nPrompt: I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?\\nLet\\'s think step by step.\\nOutput: First, you started with 10 apples. You gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left. Then you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples. Finally, you ate 1 apple, so you would remain with 10 apples.\\n\\n5. Few-shot CoT:\\nExample:\\nPrompt: [Few-shot examples] ... \\nQuestion: When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I\\'m 70 how old is my sister?\\nOutput: When the narrator was 6, his sister was half his age, which is 3. Now that the narrator is 70, his sister would be 70 - 3 = 67 years old. The answer is 67.\\n\\n6. Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT):\\nAuto-CoT is a method that automatically generates diverse and effective CoT examples to use in prompts, without manual curation.\\n\\n7. Self-Consistency:\\nExample:\\nPrompt: When I was 6 my sister was half my age. Now I\\'m 70 how old is my sister?\\nOutput: When I was 6 my sister was half my age, so she was 3. Now I am 70, so she is 70/2 = 35. The answer is 35.\\n\\n8. Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting:\\nToT is a framework that organizes the LLM\\'s thoughts into a tree structure, enabling systematic exploration of different reasoning paths.\\n\\n9. Graph-of-Thought (GoT) Prompting:\\nGoT models human thought processes as a graph rather than a simple chain, capturing the non-linear nature of reasoning.\\n\\n10. Skeleton-of-Thought Prompting:\\nSoT prompts the LLM to first outline the answer\\'s skeleton, then fill in the details in parallel, improving efficiency.\\n\\n11. Chain-of-Verification (CoVe):\\nCoVe prompts the LLM to first generate a draft response, then plan and execute verification steps to correct any mistakes before providing the final answer.\\n\\n12.

This innovation has catalyzed a transformative wave, enabling individuals to program computers effortlessly through simple text prompts.\\n- Prompt engineering is a technique for directing an LLM‚Äôs responses toward specific outcomes without altering the model‚Äôs weights or parameters, relying solely on strategic in-context prompting. It entails the art of effectively communicating with AI to elicit desired results.\\n- This method is applied across a spectrum of tasks, ranging from question-answering to arithmetic reasoning. It serves as a tool to explore the boundaries and potentials of LLMs.\\n\\n## Prompts\\n- To grasp the concept of prompt engineering, it is essential to first understand what prompts are and their role.\\n- Prompts constitute the initial text inputs given to a model, which it uses to generate responses or accomplish tasks.\\n- These are sets of instructions provided to AI or chatbots, like ChatGPT, for task execution. They vary in nature, including summarization, arithmetic problem-solving, and more commonly, question-answering.\\n- Therefore, the goal of prompt engineering is to refine these prompts to enhance the model‚Äôs accuracy and relevance in its outputs.\\n- In the following section, we will examine some prevalent prompt types, with a focus on the two most widely used prompting methodologies: zero-shot and few-shot prompting.\\n\\n## Zero-shot Prompting\\n- Zero-shot learning involves feeding the task to the model without any examples that indicate the desired output, hence the name zero-shot. For example, we could feed a model a sentence and expect it to output the sentiment of that sentence.\\n- \\nLet‚Äôs look at an example below from DAIR-AI:\\n\\n- Prompt:\\n\\nLet‚Äôs look at an example below from DAIR-AI:\\n[DAIR-AI](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide/blob/10310b42259b14dc541ea6bd6ad343fd6e08b68f/guides/prompts-advanced-usage.md#zero-shot-prompting)\\n```\\nClassify the text into neutral, negative, or positive. Text: I think the vacation is okay.\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\nClassify the text into neutral, negative, or positive. Text: I think the vacation is okay.\\n\\n```\\n\\n- Output:\\n\\n```\\nNeutral\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\nNeutral\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Few-shot Prompting\\n- Few-shot learning, on the other hand, involves providing the model with a small number of high-quality examples that include both input and desired output for the target task. By seeing these good examples, the model can better understand the human intention and criteria for generating accurate outputs. As a result, few-shot learning often leads to better performance compared to zero-shot learning. However, this approach can consume more tokens and may encounter context length limitations when dealing with long input and output text.\\n- Large language models, such as GPT-3, excel in zero-shot capabilities. However, for complex tasks where we see degraded performance, few-shot learning comes to the rescue! To enhance performance, we perform in-context learning using few-shot prompting by offering demonstrations in the prompt that guide the model to carry out the task. In other words, conditioning the model on a selection of task-specific examples helps improve the model‚Äôs performance.\\n- \\nLet‚Äôs look at an example below from Brown et al.:\\n\\n- Prompt:\\n\\nLet‚Äôs look at an example below from Brown et al.:\\n[Brown et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)\\n```\\nA \"whatpu\" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania.

Yao et el. (2023) and Long (2023) recently proposed Tree of Thoughts (ToT), a framework that generalizes over chain-of-thought prompting and encourages exploration over thoughts that serve as intermediate steps for general problem solving with language models. Put simply, organizing the LLM‚Äôs thoughts into nodes in a ToT fashion allows us to combine thought with a symbolic tree search algorithm. This opens the door to optimal ‚Äòthought path‚Äô selection, taking the LLM‚Äôs planning up to the next level of complexity.\\n- ToT maintains a tree of thoughts, where thoughts represent coherent language sequences that serve as intermediate steps toward solving a problem. This approach enables an LM to self-evaluate the progress intermediate thoughts make towards solving a problem through a deliberate reasoning process. The LM ability to generate and evaluate thoughts is then combined with search algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search and depth-first search) to enable systematic exploration of thoughts with lookahead and backtracking.\\n- The ToT framework is illustrated below (source):\\n\\n[Yao et el. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601)\\n[Long (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08291)\\n[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601)\\n\\n![](/primers/ai/assets/prompt/ToT1.webp)\\n\\n- \\nWhen using ToT, different tasks requires defining the number of candidates and the number of thoughts/steps. For instance, as demonstrated in the paper, Game of 24 is used as a mathematical reasoning task which requires decomposing the thoughts into 3 steps, each involving an intermediate equation. At each step, the best b=5 candidates are kept.\\n\\n- \\nTo perform BFS in ToT for the Game of 24 task, the LM is prompted to evaluate each thought candidate as ‚Äúsure/maybe/impossible‚Äù with regard to reaching 24. As stated by the authors, ‚Äúthe aim is to promote correct partial solutions that can be verdicted within few lookahead trials, and eliminate impossible partial solutions based on ‚Äútoo big/small‚Äù commonsense, and keep the rest ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù‚Äù. Values are sampled 3 times for each thought. The process is illustrated below:\\n\\n\\nWhen using ToT, different tasks requires defining the number of candidates and the number of thoughts/steps.

(2023) and Long (2023) are similar. Both enhance LLM‚Äôs capability for complex problem solving through tree search via a multi-round conversation. One of the main difference is that Yao et el. (2023) leverages DFS/BFS/beam search, while the tree search strategy (i.e. when to backtrack and backtracking by how many levels, etc.) proposed in Long (2023) is driven by a ‚ÄúToT Controller‚Äù trained through reinforcement learning. DFS/BFS/Beam search are generic solution search strategies with no adaptation to specific problems. In comparison, a ToT Controller trained through RL might be able learn from new data set or through self-play (AlphaGo vs. brute force search), and hence the RL-based ToT system can continue to evolve and learn new knowledge even with a fixed LLM.\\n\\n[here](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm)\\n[here](https://github.com/jieyilong/tree-of-thought-puzzle-solver)\\n[Yao et el.

However, human thought processes are often non-linear, rather than simply sequential chains of thoughts.\\n- Yao et al. (2023) proposed Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also as a graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them as edges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking and allows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes. Similar to Multimodal-CoT, they modeled GoT reasoning as a two-stage framework, generating rationales first and then producing the final answer. Specifically, they employ an additional graph-of-thoughts encoder for GoT representation learning and fuse the GoT representation with the original input representation through a gated fusion mechanism.\\n\\n[Yao et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16582)\\n> \\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) have revolutionized data pipeline orchestration tools by modelling the flow of dependencies in a graph without circular loops. Unlike trees, DAGs can model paths that fork and then converge back together, given GoT a big advantage over ToT!\\n\\n\\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) have revolutionized data pipeline orchestration tools by modelling the flow of dependencies in a graph without circular loops. Unlike trees, DAGs can model paths that fork and then converge back together, given GoT a big advantage over ToT!\\n- Moving beyond pure orchestration, the Graph of Thought approach represents all information in a graph structure, with nodes representing concepts or entities and edges denoting relationships between them. Each node contains information that can be processed by the LLM, while the connections between nodes capture contextual associations and dependencies. This graph structure enables the model to traverse and explore the relationships between concepts, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the input and informing the development of a more logically coherent plan (similar to System One and System Two thinking in the human brain).\\n- They implement a GoT reasoning model on the T5 pre-trained model and evaluate its performance on a text-only reasoning task (GSM8K) and a multimodal reasoning task (ScienceQA).\\n- Their model achieves significant improvement over the strong CoT baseline with 3.41% and 5.08% on the GSM8K test set with T5-base and T5-large architectures, respectively. Additionally, our model boosts accuracy from 84.91% to 91.54% using the T5-base model and from 91.68% to 92.77% using the T5-large model over the state-of-the-art Multimodal-CoT on the ScienceQA test set. Experiments have shown that GoT achieves comparable results to Multimodal-CoT (large) with over 700M parameters, despite having fewer than 250M backbone model parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of GoT.\\n- The following figure from the paper (source) illustrates the framework overview for GoT.\\n\\n[System One and System Two thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)\\n[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16582)\\n\\n![](/primers/ai/assets/prompt/GoT.jpg)\\n\\n## Skeleton-of-Thought Prompting\\n[Skeleton-of-Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15337)\\n- Proposed in Skeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding by Ning et al. from Tsinghua University and Microsoft Research.\\n- Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), aimed at reducing the end-to-end generation latency of large language models (LLMs) by tackling the sequential decoding process inherent in state-of-the-art LLMs. SoT encourages LLMs to first outline the answer‚Äôs skeleton and then fill in the details of each point in parallel, leveraging API calls or batch decoding for efficiency.\\n- SoT‚Äôs methodology mirrors human cognitive processes in structuring and elaborating responses, intending to make LLMs‚Äô processing more intuitive and effective. It achieves considerable speed-ups (up to 2.39x) across 12 models, demonstrating improved efficiency and, in many cases, enhanced answer quality across various question categories including knowledge, generic, common-sense, roleplay, and counterfactual queries.\\n- The approach is evaluated on two datasets (Vicuna-80 and WizardLM) with diverse LLMs, showing not only efficiency gains but also potential improvements in diversity and relevance of the answers, indicating SoT‚Äôs capacity to guide LLMs towards more human-like reasoning and articulation.\\n- The following figure from the paper offers an illustration of SoT. In contrast to the traditional approach that produces answers sequentially, SoT accelerates it by producing different parts of answers in parallel. In more detail, given the question, SoT first prompts the LLM to give out the skeleton, then conducts batched decoding or parallel API calls to expand multiple points in parallel, and finally aggregates the outputs together to get the final answer.\\n\\n[Skeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15337)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/SoT.jpg)\\n\\n- SoT provides considerable speed-ups while maintaining (or even improving) answer quality for many question types. However, the biggest limitation is that SoT is not suitable for questions that require step-by-step reasoning. Towards pushing the practical adoption of SoT, they explore the possibility of adaptively triggering SoT only when it is suitable. To achieve that, they propose a router module ‚Äì SoT with router (SoT-R) ‚Äì that decides if SoT should be applied for the user request, and then call either SoT or normal decoding accordingly. Put simply, SoT-R adaptively triggers SoT by employing a router to identify suitable questions. This paradigm also aligns with the recent trends of composing multiple models to solve complicated tasks. To implement the router, they explore two options: LLM prompting as the router (no model training is needed), and trained RoBERTa as the router. SoT-R integrates a router mechanism to selectively apply SoT to suitable questions, optimizing both speed and quality of responses. This extension illustrates the potential for adaptive application based on question characteristics, reinforcing SoT‚Äôs role as a pioneering data-level optimization strategy for LLM inference efficiency.\\n- By diverging from traditional model- and system-level optimization, SoT and SoT-R represent innovative steps towards enhancing LLMs‚Äô capabilities, emphasizing efficiency, and quality in generated responses, and highlighting the potential of aligning LLM processes more closely with human thought patterns.\\n- Blog\\n\\n[Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/skeleton-of-thought-parallel-decoding-speeds-up-and-improves-llm-output/)\\n## Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)\\n[Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495)\\n- Generation of plausible yet incorrect factual information, termed hallucination, is an unsolved issue in large language models.\\n- \\n\\nProposed in Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models by Dhuliawala et al. from Meta AI and ETH Zurich studies the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes.\\n\\n\\n- Proposed in Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models by Dhuliawala et al. from Meta AI and ETH Zurich studies the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes.\\n- They develop the Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions independently so the answers are not biased by other responses; and (iv) generates its final verified response.\\n- The following table from the paper illustrates the Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method. Given a user query, a large language model generates a baseline response that may contain inaccuracies, e.g. factual hallucinations. We show a query here which failed for ChatGPT (see section 9 for more details). To improve this, CoVe first generates a plan of a set of verification questions to ask, and then executes that plan by answering them and hence checking for agreement. We find that individual verification questions are typically answered with higher accuracy than the original accuracy of the facts in the original longform generation. Finally, the revised response takes into account the verifications. The factored version of CoVe answers verification questions such that they cannot condition on the original response, avoiding repetition and improving performance.\\n\\n- Proposed in Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models by Dhuliawala et al. from Meta AI and ETH Zurich studies the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes.\\n\\n[Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CoVe.jpg)\\n\\n- Via experiments, they show that CoVe decreases hallucinations across a variety of tasks, from list-based questions from Wikidata, closed book MultiSpanQA and longform text generation.\\n\\n## ReAct Prompting\\n[ReAct Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)\\n- \\nYao et al., 2022 introduced a framework named ReAct where LLMs are used to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner.\\n\\n- \\nGenerating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions.

But it‚Äôs lack of access to the external world or inability to update its knowledge can lead to issues like fact hallucination and error propagation.\\n\\n- \\nReAct is a general paradigm that combines reasoning and acting with LLMs. ReAct prompts LLMs to generate verbal reasoning traces and actions for a task. This allows the system to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust plans for acting while also enabling interaction to external environments (e.g., Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into the reasoning. The figure below (source) shows an example of ReAct and the different steps involved to perform question answering.\\n\\n\\nReAct is inspired by the synergies between ‚Äúacting‚Äù and ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù which allow humans to learn new tasks and make decisions or reasoning.\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has shown the capabilities of LLMs to carry out reasoning traces to generate answers to questions involving arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, among other tasks (Wei et al., 2022).

For tasks where reasoning is of primary importance (e.g., HotpotQA), multiple thought-action-observation steps are used for the task-solving trajectory. For decision making tasks involving lots of action steps, thoughts are used sparsely.\\n\\n### Results on Knowledge-Intensive Tasks\\n- The paper first evaluates ReAct on knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks such as question answering (HotPotQA) and fact verification (Fever), as shown in the figure below (source). PaLM-540B is used as the base model for prompting.\\n\\n[Fever](https://fever.ai/resources.html)\\n[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)\\n\\n![](/primers/ai/assets/prompt/table1.png)\\n\\n- \\nThe prompting results on HotPotQA and Fever using different prompting methods show that ReAct generally performs better than Act (involves acting only) on both tasks.\\n\\n- \\nWe can also observe that ReAct outperforms CoT on Fever and lags behind CoT on HotpotQA.

ReAct is evaluated on two benchmarks called ALFWorld (text-based game) and WebShop (online shopping website environment). Both involve complex environments that require reasoning to act and explore effectively.\\n\\n- \\nNote that the ReAct prompts are designed differently for these tasks while still keeping the same core idea of combining reasoning and acting.

Act, without any thoughts, fails to correctly decompose goals into subgoals. Reasoning seems to be advantageous in ReAct for these types of tasks but current prompting-based methods are still far from the performance of expert humans on these tasks.\\n\\n### ReAct Usage with LangChain\\n- \\nBelow is a high-level example of how the ReAct prompting approach works in practice. We will be using OpenAI for the LLM and LangChain as it already has built-in functionality that leverages the ReAct framework to build agents that perform tasks by combining the power of LLMs and different tools.\\n\\n- \\nFirst, let‚Äôs install and import the necessary libraries:\\n\\n\\nBelow is a high-level example of how the ReAct prompting approach works in practice.

Note that we are using a search API for searching external information and LLM as a math tool.\\n\\n```\\nllm = OpenAI(model_name=\"text-davinci-003\" ,temperature=0)\\ntools = load_tools([\"google-serper\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\nllm = OpenAI(model_name=\"text-davinci-003\" ,temperature=0)\\ntools = load_tools([\"google-serper\", \"llm-math\"], llm=llm)\\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=\"zero-shot-react-description\", verbose=True)\\n\\n```\\n\\n- Once that‚Äôs configured, we can now run the agent with the desired query/prompt. Notice that here we are not expected to provide few-shot exemplars as explained in the paper.\\n\\n```\\nagent.run(\"Who is Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\")\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\nagent.run(\"Who is Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend? What is his current age raised to the 0.23 power?\")\\n\\n```\\n\\n- The chain execution looks as follows:\\n\\n```\\n> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\\n I need to find out who Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend is and then calculate his age raised to the 0.23 power.\\nAction: Search\\nAction Input: \"Olivia Wilde boyfriend\"\\nObservation: Olivia Wilde started dating Harry Styles after ending her years-long engagement to Jason Sudeikis ‚Äî see their relationship timeline.\\nThought: I need to find out Harry Styles\\' age.\\nAction: Search\\nAction Input: \"Harry Styles age\"\\nObservation: 29 years\\nThought: I need to calculate 29 raised to the 0.23 power.\\nAction: Calculator\\nAction Input: 29^0.23\\nObservation: Answer: 2.169459462491557\\n\\nThought: I now know the final answer.\\nFinal Answer: Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557.\\n\\n> Finished chain.\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...\\n I need to find out who Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend is and then calculate his age raised to the 0.23 power.\\nAction: Search\\nAction Input: \"Olivia Wilde boyfriend\"\\nObservation: Olivia Wilde started dating Harry Styles after ending her years-long engagement to Jason Sudeikis ‚Äî see their relationship timeline.\\nThought: I need to find out Harry Styles\\' age.\\nAction: Search\\nAction Input: \"Harry Styles age\"\\nObservation: 29 years\\nThought: I need to calculate 29 raised to the 0.23 power.\\nAction: Calculator\\nAction Input: 29^0.23\\nObservation: Answer: 2.169459462491557\\n\\nThought: I now know the final answer.\\nFinal Answer: Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557.\\n\\n> Finished chain.\\n\\n```\\n\\n- The output we get is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n\"Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557.\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\"Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde\\'s boyfriend, is 29 years old and his age raised to the 0.23 power is 2.169459462491557.\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n- We adapted the example from the LangChain documentation, so credit goes to them. We encourage the learner to explore different combination of tools and tasks.\\n\\n[LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/react)\\n## Active-Prompt\\n- \\nChain-of-thought (CoT) methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars. The problem with this is that the exemplars might not be the most effective examples for the different tasks.

Stanford‚Äôs Alpaca is a recent example that uses instruction tuning to offer performance similar to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT3.5 (without performing RLHF, unlike GPT3.5).\\n- Instruction tuning finetunes a pretrained model with tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to enables the model to be better aligned to user intention and follow instructions. \\n‚ÄúWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in detail, trying to be specific and precise, clearly specifying what to do (rather than saying not to do something)‚Äù (source).\\n\\n[Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)\\n[(source)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#instruction-prompting)\\n## Recursive Prompting\\n- Recursive prompting refers to a method of problem-solving that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, which are then solved recursively through a series of prompts.\\n- This approach can be particularly useful for tasks that require compositional generalization, where a language model must learn to combine different pieces of information to solve a problem.\\n- In the context of natural language processing, recursive prompting can involve using a few-shot prompting approach to decompose a complex problem into sub-problems, and then sequentially solving the extracted sub-problems using the solution to the previous sub-problems to answer the next one. This approach can be used for tasks such as math problems or question answering, where a language model needs to be able to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts to arrive at a solution.\\n- \\nThe language model can then solve each sub-problem independently or sequentially, using the solution to the previous sub-problem to answer the next one. For example:\\n\\n- Prompt:\\n\\nThe language model can then solve each sub-problem independently or sequentially, using the solution to the previous sub-problem to answer the next one.

In addition, ART is extensible as it also enables humans to fix mistakes in the reasoning steps or add new tools by simply updating the task and tool libraries. The process is demonstrated below (source):\\n\\nCombining CoT prompting and tools in an interleaved manner has shown to be a strong and robust approach to address many tasks with LLMs. These approaches typically require hand-crafting task-specific demonstrations and carefully scripted interleaving of model generations with tool use.

These tasks generally don‚Äôt require additional background knowledge.\\n- For more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks, it‚Äôs possible to build a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. This enables more factual consistency, improves reliability of the generated responses, and helps to mitigate the problem of ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù.\\n- Meta AI researchers introduced a method called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to address such knowledge-intensive tasks. RAG combines an information retrieval component with a text generator model. RAG can be fine-tuned and it‚Äôs internal knowledge can be modified in an efficient manner and without needing retraining of the entire model.\\n- RAG takes an input and retrieves a set of relevant/supporting documents given a source (e.g., Wikipedia). The documents are concatenated as context with the original input prompt and fed to the text generator which produces the final output. This makes RAG adaptive for situations where facts could evolve over time. This is very useful as LLMs‚Äôs parametric knowledge is static. RAG allows language models to bypass retraining, enabling access to the latest information for generating reliable outputs via retrieval-based generation.\\n- Lewis et al., (2021) proposed a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for RAG. A pre-trained seq2seq model is used as the parametric memory and a dense vector index of Wikipedia is used as non-parametric memory (accessed using a neural pre-trained retriever). Below is an overview (source)  of how the approach works:\\n\\n[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/)\\n[(source)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401)\\n\\n![](/primers/ai/assets/prompt/rag.png)\\n\\n- RAG performs strong on several benchmarks such as Natural Questions, WebQuestions, and CuratedTrec. RAG generates responses that are more factual, specific, and diverse when tested on MS-MARCO and Jeopardy questions. RAG also improves results on FEVER fact verification.\\n- This shows the potential of RAG as a viable option for enhancing outputs of language models in knowledge-intensive tasks.\\n- More recently, these retriever-based approaches have become more popular and are combined with popular LLMs like ChatGPT to improve capabilities and factual consistency.\\n- You can find a simple example of how to use retrievers and LLMs for question answering with sources from the LangChain documentation.\\n- For a detailed discourse on RAG, please refer to our RAG primer.\\n\\n[Natural Questions](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions)\\n[WebQuestions](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/webquestions)\\n[simple example of how to use retrievers and LLMs for question answering with sources](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/vector_db_qa_with_sources.html)\\n[RAG](../RAG)\\n### The ‚ÄúNeedle in a Haystack‚Äù Test\\n- To understand the in-context retrieval ability of long-context LLMs over various parts of their prompt, a simple ‚Äòneedle in a haystack‚Äô analysis could be conducted. This method involves embedding specific, targeted information (the ‚Äòneedle‚Äô) within a larger, more complex body of text (the ‚Äòhaystack‚Äô). The purpose is to test the LLM‚Äôs ability to identify and utilize this specific piece of information amidst a deluge of other data.\\n- In practical terms, the analysis could involve inserting a unique fact or data point into a lengthy, seemingly unrelated text. The LLM would then be tasked with tasks or queries that require it to recall or apply this embedded information. This setup mimics real-world situations where essential details are often buried within extensive content, and the ability to retrieve such details is crucial.\\n- The experiment could be structured to assess various aspects of the LLM‚Äôs performance. For instance, the placement of the ‚Äòneedle‚Äô could be varied‚Äîearly, middle, or late in the text‚Äîto see if the model‚Äôs retrieval ability changes based on information location. Additionally, the complexity of the surrounding ‚Äòhaystack‚Äô can be modified to test the LLM‚Äôs performance under varying degrees of contextual difficulty. By analyzing how well the LLM performs in these scenarios, insights can be gained into its in-context retrieval capabilities and potential areas for improvement.\\n- This can be accomplished using the Needle In A Haystack library. The following plot shows OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4-128K‚Äôs (top) and (bottom) performance with varying context length.\\n\\n[Needle In A Haystack](https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack)\\n\\n![](../../../primers/ai/assets/RAG/GPT4_haystack.jpg)\\n\\n\\n![](../../../primers/ai/assets/RAG/Claude_haystack.jpg)\\n\\n- However, in their Long context prompting for Claude 2.1 blog, Anthropic noted that adding ‚ÄúHere is the most relevant sentence in the context:‚Äù to the start of Claude‚Äôs response raised the score from 27% to 98% on the original evaluation!\\n- The figure below from the blog shows that Claude 2.1‚Äôs performance when retrieving an individual sentence across its full 200K token context window.

It introduces the Chain-of-Note (CoN) framework to address two main robustness challenges in RALMs: noise and unknown scenarios.\\n- The core of CoN involves generating sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling thorough evaluation of their relevance to the query and integrating this information to formulate a final answer.\\n- CoN focuses on improving the robustness of RALMs in handling irrelevant or noisy information and responding appropriately when faced with queries outside its knowledge scope.\\n- The framework was tested on various open-domain question answering datasets. Notably, CoN achieved an average improvement of +7.9 in exact match scores with entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions beyond the pre-training knowledge scope.\\n- The following image from the paper shows that compared with the current RALMs, the core idea behind CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for the retrieved documents, ensuring a systematic assessment of their relevance to the input question before formulating a final response.\\n\\n[Chain-of-Note (CoN): Enhancing Robustness in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09210)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CoN1.jpg)\\n\\n- The following image from the paper shows an illustration of the CoN framework with three distinct types of reading notes. Type (a) depicts the scenario where the language model identifies a document that directly answers the query, leading to a final answer formulated from the retrieved information. Type (b) represents situations where the retrieved document, while not directly answering the query, provides contextual insights, enabling the language model to integrate this context with its inherent knowledge to deduce an answer. Type (c) illustrates instances where the language model encounters irrelevant documents and lacks the necessary knowledge to respond, resulting in an ‚Äúunknown‚Äù answer.

The framework aims to produce more factual rationales and reduce hallucination in generation.\\n- CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Initially, CoK prepares preliminary rationales and answers for a knowledge-intensive question while identifying relevant knowledge domains. It then corrects these rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from identified domains, thereby providing a better foundation for the final answer.\\n- The following figure from the paper shows a comparison of different methods: (a) chain-of-thought with self-consistency, (b) verify-and-edit, and (c) CoK. CoK incorporates heterogeneous sources for knowledge retrieval and performs dynamic knowledge adapting. For clarity and succinct presentation, only pivotal steps are shown in the figure.\\n\\n[Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK): Grounding Large Language Models via Dynamic Knowledge Adapting over Heterogeneous Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13269)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CoK.jpg)\\n\\n- The following figure from the paper shows our proposed chain-of-knowledge (CoK) framework, consisting of (I) Reasoning preparation, (II) Dynamic knowledge adapting, and (III) Answer consolidation. n.s.: natural sentence.\\n\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CoK2.jpg)\\n\\n- A key aspect of CoK is its use of both unstructured and structured knowledge sources, such as Wikidata and tables, for more reliable factual information. To access these varied sources, the framework introduces an adaptive query generator that generates queries for different query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences.\\n- CoK corrects rationales progressively, using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent ones, minimizing error propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoK‚Äôs consistent improvement in LLMs‚Äô performance across different domains on knowledge-intensive tasks.\\n- The paper also details the challenges and limitations of existing methods in augmenting LLMs with external knowledge and how CoK addresses these by its design. It provides a comprehensive approach to improve factual correctness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs for a wide range of applications.\\n\\n## Chain-of-Code (CoC) Prompting\\n[Chain-of-Code (CoC) Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04474)\\n- Proposed in Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator.\\n- This paper by Li et al. introduces the Chain of Code (CoC), an approach that enhances language models‚Äô (LMs) reasoning capabilities by integrating code-writing with an LM-augmented code emulator (LMulator), which executing code with a language model that simulates the execution if the code is not executable.\\n- CoC leverages code writing by LMs for improved reasoning in logic, arithmetic, and semantic tasks, often blending these aspects.\\n- The LMulator acts as a pseudo-interpreter, selectively emulating code execution for parts of the program that are not executable by a standard interpreter, like ‚Äúdetect_sarcasm(string)‚Äù function in semantic tasks.\\n- This approach allows LMs to format semantic sub-tasks as flexible pseudocode, with the LMulator catching undefined behaviors to simulate expected outputs.\\n- CoC outperforms other methods like Chain of Thought, particularly in benchmarks like BIG-Bench Hard, where it achieved an 84% score, a 12% gain.\\n- The following figure from the paper depicts various prompt engineering methods to solve advanced problems, (a) Chain of Thought prompting breaks the problem down into intermediate steps, (b) Program of Thoughts prompting writes and executes code, and (c) ScratchPad prompting simulates running already written code by tracking\\nintermediate steps through a program state.

CoS addresses this by replacing natural language descriptions of spatial relationships with symbolic representations, leading to improved performance and efficiency.\\n- The following image from the paper illustrates an example for comparison between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) that elicits large language models in tackling complex planning tasks with higher performance and fewer input tokens. They let the model generate CoT/CoS during inference in a few-shot manner. Results were taken in May 2023 with ChatGPT and can be subject to change.\\n\\n[Chain-of-Symbol Prompting for Spatial Relationships in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10276)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CoS.jpg)\\n\\n- The following image from the paper shows <input, Chain of Symbol, output> example triples for our three proposed tasks: Brick World, NLVR-based Manipulation, and Natural Language Navigation, and SPARTUN dataset (Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2022). Chains of Symbols are highlighted.\\n\\n```\\n<input, Chain of Symbol, output>\\n```\\n\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CoS2.jpg)\\n\\n- CoS was evaluated using three spatial planning tasks (Brick World, NLVR-based Manipulation, and Natural Language Navigation) and a spatial question-answering dataset (SPARTUN). The method showed significant performance gains, for instance, up to 60.8% accuracy improvement in the Brick World task for ChatGPT, and reduced the number of tokens in prompts by up to 65.8%.\\n- The authors also demonstrated the robustness of CoS across different LLMs and languages, showing that it consistently outperforms CoT in accuracy and token efficiency. This indicates the potential of symbolic representations in enhancing LLMs‚Äô spatial reasoning capabilities.\\n\\n## Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting\\n[Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06599)\\n- Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) have shown impressive performance in code generation. LLMs take prompts as inputs, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is the state-of-the-art prompting technique. CoT prompting asks LLMs first to generate CoTs (i.e., intermediate natural language reasoning steps) and then output the code. However, CoT prompting is designed for natural language generation and has low accuracy in code generation.\\n- Proposed in Structured Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Code Generation by Li et al. from Peking University proposes Structured CoTs (SCoTs) and present a novel prompting technique for code generation, named SCoT prompting.\\n- Their motivation is that source code contains rich structural information and any code can be composed of three program structures (i.e., sequence, branch, and loop structures). Intuitively, structured intermediate reasoning steps make for structured source code. Thus, they ask LLMs to use program structures to build CoTs, obtaining SCoTs. Then, LLMs generate the final code based on SCoTs.\\n- Compared to CoT prompting, SCoT prompting explicitly constrains LLMs to think about how to solve requirements from the view of source code and further the performance of LLMs in code generation.\\n- The following figure from the paper shows a comparison of Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) and our Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT).\\n\\n[Structured Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06599)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/SCoT.jpg)\\n\\n- They apply SCoT prompting to two LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT and Codex) and evaluate it on three benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, and MBCPP). (1) SCoT prompting outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline - CoT prompting by up to 13.79% in Pass@1. (2) Human evaluation shows human developers prefer programs from SCoT prompting. (3) SCoT prompting is robust to examples and achieves substantial improvements.\\n\\n## Contrastive Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) Prompting\\n[Contrastive Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09277)\\n- Proposed in Contrastive Chain-of-Thought Prompting by Chia et al. from DAMO, Singapore University of Technology and Desing, and NTU Singapore.\\n- This paper introduces a novel method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This method, termed Contrastive Chain of Thought (CCoT), involves providing both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, inspired by the way humans learn from both correct and incorrect methods.\\n- The concept of CCoT is based on the idea that adding contrastive examples, comprising both valid and invalid reasoning, can significantly improve the performance of LLMs in reasoning tasks.\\n- The process of using CCoT involves preparing a prompt, providing a valid chain of thought (CoT) explanation, generating contrastive invalid CoT explanations from the valid one, and then introducing a new user prompt.\\n- The following image from the paper shows an overview of contrastive chain-of-thought (right), with comparison to common prompting methods.\\n\\n[Contrastive Chain-of-Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09277)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/CCoT.jpg)\\n\\n- CCoT has demonstrated improvements of approximately 4-16% over traditional CoT on evaluations focused on strategic and mathematical reasoning. When combined with self-consistency techniques, CCoT becomes even more effective, showing an additional improvement of about 5%.\\n- A novel approach for generating invalid CoT explanations is introduced. This involves identifying key entities (like numbers, equations, persons) in the valid explanation and then shuffling them to create an invalid explanation.\\n- The authors identify five different categories of negative rationales to enhance learning. These include using irrelevant entities, erroneous order of logic, and incorrect logic.\\n- To validate the effectiveness of CCoT, the method was tested on GPT-3.5 using 500 samples across seven different datasets. The results showed that CCoT outperforms standard CoT across all datasets.\\n- This work represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing and reasoning, offering an innovative method to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by learning from a mix of correct and incorrect reasoning examples.\\n\\n## Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting\\n[Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13339)\\n- Proposed in Enhancing Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models through Logic by Zhao et al. from the University of Hamburg.\\n- Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) is aimed at enhancing the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating principles from symbolic logic. Recognizing the limitations of LLMs in performing multi-step reasoning tasks without losing coherence or succumbing to hallucinations, LogiCoT presents a neurosymbolic framework that systematically verifies and revises reasoning steps to ensure logical consistency and correctness.\\n- The methodology behind LogiCoT involves a two-fold process: first, applying reductio ad absurdum to identify and correct logical fallacies within the reasoning chain; second, structuring the reasoning process to allow for systematic verification and revision of each reasoning step, based on logical principles. This process is complemented by the introduction of a chain growth mechanism that selectively revises implausible reasoning steps, thus enhancing the model‚Äôs reasoning accuracy without unnecessary computational overhead.\\n- The figure below from the paper shows an overview of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and LogiCoT. In CoT, the failure of entailment (red) makes the rest of the deduction untrustworthy (gray), consequently impeding the overall success of the deduction. In contrast, LogiCoT is designed to think-verify-revise: it adopts those who pass the verification (green) and revise (blue) those who do not, thereby effectively improving the overall reasoning capability.\\n\\n[Enhancing Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models through Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13339)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/LogiCoT1.jpg)\\n\\n- The figure below from the paper shows an arithmetic example when applying LogiCoT verification and revision on CoT reasoning paths. Every reasoning step has to undergo a verification procedure, which is mainly directed by two post hoc reviews generated by the LLM (yellow) independently. In this example, step #1 fails (red) the verification because the discriminator agrees with the ‚ÄúReview Y‚Äù which correctly points out the error in this step. As a result, the LLM further revises (blue) the original step into a new step #1 and re-generates the trailing paths based on the revision. The procedure unrolls till every step is verified to be valid ( ). Key snippets of prompts used to achieve each procedure are shown in dotted boxes.\\n\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/LogiCoT2.jpg)\\n\\n- Experimental evaluations demonstrate LogiCoT‚Äôs effectiveness across a variety of domains, including arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, causal inference, and social interaction tasks. The experiments, conducted on datasets such as GSM8K, AQuA, and others, utilizing models ranging from Vicuna-7b to GPT-4, highlight LogiCoT‚Äôs ability to significantly improve reasoning performance, especially as model size increases. Notably, the transition from a composing to an adopting strategy in error detection further accentuates LogiCoT‚Äôs advantages in enhancing reasoning accuracy and coherence.\\n- Moreover, the research delves into the impacts of logical revision on reasoning cases, distinguishing between worsening and improving rates to quantify the efficacy of LogiCoT interventions. The findings suggest that while larger models benefit more from LogiCoT‚Äôs revisions, there is a nuanced balance between improving reasoning accuracy and avoiding unnecessary interventions.\\n- In conclusion, the paper posits that LogiCoT represents a significant step forward in leveraging logical principles to refine the reasoning processes of LLMs. By enabling systematic verification and revision of reasoning steps, LogiCoT not only improves the accuracy and logical consistency of LLM outputs but also opens new avenues for research into neurosymbolic AI and its applications in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of generative models.\\n\\n## System 2 Attention Prompting\\n[System 2 Attention Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11829)\\n- Proposed in System 2 Attention (is something you might need too) by Weston and Sukhbaatar from Meta.\\n- This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) named System 2 Attention (S2A). This concept is inspired by the human cognitive process of deliberate attention (System 2 reasoning) and aims to solve the problem of standard soft attention in Transformers, which often struggles with filtering out irrelevant information from the input context.\\n- S2A targets the challenge in standard soft attention mechanisms where irrelevant information in the input context leads to degraded performance in tasks like opinion analysis, question answering, and longform content generation. The central issue is the model‚Äôs inability to discern and focus only on the relevant context portions.\\n- S2A introduces a method where the LLM first regenerates the input context, eliminating irrelevant parts. This approach leverages the LLM‚Äôs natural language understanding and instruction-following capabilities to improve the quality of attention and the responses by focusing only on the regenerated, relevant context. Thus, S2A involves a two-step process to improve attention and response quality by focusing only on regenerated, relevant context:\\n    \\nContext Regeneration: Given a context \\\\(x\\\\), S2A regenerates this context to \\\\(x\\'\\\\), removing irrelevant parts that could adversely affect the output. This is denoted as \\\\(x\\' \\\\sim S2A(x)\\\\).\\nResponse Generation with Refined Context: The final response is produced using the regenerated context \\\\(x\\'\\\\) instead of the original, leading to more accurate and factual responses.

This study indicated a 10.9% average improvement in performance, truthfulness, and responsibility metrics with EmotionPrompt.\\n- The paper delves into why EmotionPrompt is effective, discussing factors that may influence its performance and providing insights into the integration of emotional intelligence in LLMs.\\n- Example use case: Imagine an educational application where a language model assists students in learning a new topic. Normally, a prompt might simply ask the model to explain a concept. However, with EmotionPrompt, the query might include a statement like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crucial for my upcoming exam to understand this topic.‚Äù This emotional addition motivates the LLM to generate more thoughtful, comprehensive, and engaging explanations, potentially improving the student‚Äôs understanding and retention of the material.\\n\\n## Thread of Thought (ThoT) Prompting\\n[Thread of Thought (ThoT) Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08734)\\n- Proposed in Thread of Thought (ThoT): Unraveling Chaotic Contexts by Zhou et al. from University of Macau, Microsoft, and University of Technology Sydney.\\n- This paper introduces the Thread of Thought (ThoT) strategy, a novel technique designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling chaotic contexts.

These new solutions are then assessed and added to the prompt for subsequent optimization steps.\\n- The method is first demonstrated on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, and then extended to prompt optimization. The goal here is to find instructions that maximize task accuracy.\\n- The study showcases that OPRO significantly enhances performance, with the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperforming human-designed prompts by up to 8% on the GSM8K dataset and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.\\n- OPRO presents a simple and effective approach for leveraging LLMs in optimization tasks, expanding the potential applications of these models in various real-world scenarios.\\n- Example Use Case: In a scenario involving route optimization for logistics, traditional methods may struggle with complex constraints and dynamic variables.

One-step RaR: Here, LLMs rephrase and respond to a question within a single prompt. This method is based on the human communication strategy of rephrasing for clarity and coherence. It‚Äôs shown to be effective, especially with datasets that present ambiguous questions to LLMs.\\n2. Two-step RaR: This approach involves a more intricate process where a ‚Äòrephrasing LLM‚Äô first rephrases the question, which is then combined with the original question to prompt a ‚Äòresponding LLM‚Äô. This method is beneficial for using rephrased questions across different models, with experiments showing that a question rephrased by a more advanced LLM, like GPT-4, can significantly aid a less sophisticated LLM in producing more accurate responses.\\n\\n- Both One-step and Two-step RaR significantly improve LLM performance across various tasks.\\n- One-step RaR is a straightforward and effective method to enhance LLM responses, outperforming Two-step RaR in 6 out of 10 tasks.\\n- Two-step RaR consistently improves the quality of responses, particularly in tasks where LLMs initially show poor performance. This method also demonstrates the ability to rephrase questions autonomously, leading to significant accuracy improvements.\\n\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/RAR.jpg)\\n\\n- The effectiveness of RaR was tested across multiple benchmark tasks, including Knowledge Classification, Knowledge Comparison, CommonSense QA, Date Understanding, Last Letter Concatenation, Coin Flip, and Sports Understanding. These tasks were designed to evaluate various aspects of LLM capabilities like commonsense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and sports knowledge.\\n- The performance of RaR was also examined across different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and Vicuna. It was found that all LLMs tested showed enhanced performance with Two-step RaR. Moreover, the study confirms that the rephrased questions are transferable across different LLMs, demonstrating that rephrased questions by a model like GPT-4 can significantly benefit other models like Vicuna.\\n- Additionally, the paper explores the concept of multiple rephrasings, where iterative self-rephrasing by GPT-4 is used to achieve consistent clarifications. This method shows that GPT-4 can progressively clarify concepts, even if it fails to do so in the initial attempt, with the questions becoming more elaborate after each rephrasing.\\n- Lastly, RaR is compared with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method, demonstrating that RaR offers improvements in scenarios where zero-shot CoT is ineffective, and also addresses the shortcomings inherent in few-shot CoT.\\n\\n## Scratchpad Prompting\\n[Scratchpad Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00114)\\n- Proposed in Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models.\\n- This paper by Nye et al. from MIT and Google Research, presented at NeurIPS 2021, introduces the concept of ‚Äúscratchpads‚Äù to improve the ability of large Transformer-based language models to perform complex, multi-step computations.\\n- The authors address the issue that while these models excel at tasks requiring single-step computation, they struggle with multi-step algorithmic tasks, like long addition or program execution. The proposed solution involves training models to use a scratchpad for intermediate computation steps.\\n- The paper demonstrates that using scratchpads allows models to successfully perform long addition, polynomial evaluation, and execution of arbitrary Python code.\\n- The following figure from the paper shows an overview of the proposed scratchpad approach applied to predicting code execution and comparison to direct execution prediction. (Top) Previous work has shown that large pre-trained models achieve poor performance when asked to directly predict the result of executing given computer code. (Bottom) In this work, we show that training models to use a scratchpad and predict the program execution trace line-by-line can lead to large improvements in execution prediction performance. N.B. Although the example below only has one loop iteration for each loop, all loops are unrolled across time.\\n\\n[Show Your Work: Scratchpads for Intermediate Computation with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00114)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/SyW.jpg)\\n\\n- Empirical results show that the scratchpad method leads to significant improvements in task performance, including out-of-distribution generalization and execution prediction of Python programs.\\n- The authors conclude that scratchpads offer a simple yet effective way to enhance the computational abilities of Transformer models without altering their underlying architecture.\\n\\n## Take a Step Back Prompting\\n[Take a Step Back Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06117)\\n- Proposed in Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models.\\n- Imagine you‚Äôre asked a detailed physics question. Instead of diving straight in, you first understand the fundamental law or principle that applies. Then, you use this understanding to tackle the specific question. This is the underpinning principle behind the proposal in this paper.\\n- This paper by Zheng et al. from Google DeepMind introduces a novel prompting technique named Step-Back Prompting. This method enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like PaLM-2L to perform abstractions, deriving high-level concepts and first principles from detailed instances, thus significantly enhancing their reasoning capabilities.\\n- Step-Back Prompting is a two-step process comprising Abstraction and Reasoning. In the abstraction phase, LLMs are prompted to ask high-level, broader, generic step-back questions about concepts or principles relevant to the task. The reasoning phase then uses these concepts and principles to guide the LLMs towards the solution of the original questions.\\n- The technique is exemplified in the paper with two illustrations. The following image from the paper illustrates Step-Back Prompting with two steps of Abstraction and Reasoning guided by concepts and principles. Top: an example of MMLU high-school physics where the first principle of Ideal Gas Law is retrieved via abstraction. Bottom: an example from TimeQA where the high-level concept of education history is a result of the abstraction. Left: PaLM-2L fails to answer the original question. Chain-of-Thought prompting ran into errors during intermediate reasoning steps (highlighted as red). Right: PaLM-2L successfully answers the question via Step-Back Prompting.\\n\\n[Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06117)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/step-back-prompting.jpg)\\n\\n- The authors conduct extensive experiments with Step-Back Prompting on PaLM-2L models across various challenging reasoning-intensive tasks, including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. Notably, this technique improves performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and 11%, TimeQA by 27%, and MuSiQue by 7%.\\n- The effectiveness of Step-Back Prompting is empirically validated, outperforming other methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and Take a Deep Breath (TDB) prompting, with significant improvements over baseline models.\\n- An error analysis indicates that most errors in Step-Back Prompting occur during the reasoning step, suggesting that while LLMs can be effectively taught abstraction skills, enhancing their reasoning capabilities remains a challenge.\\n- The paper positions Step-Back Prompting as a simple yet powerful method to significantly improve the reasoning ability of LLMs, especially in tasks that demand complex and deep reasoning.\\n\\n## Ask Me Anything Prompting\\n[Ask Me Anything Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02441)\\n- Proposed in Ask Me Anything: A Simple Strategy for Prompting Language Models by Arora et al. from Stanford University, Numbers Station, and UW-Madison.\\n- Ask Me Anything Prompting (AMA) is a novel prompting method for LLMs.\\n- AMA aims to overcome the brittleness of traditional prompting methods by aggregating multiple effective yet imperfect prompts to enhance model performance across various tasks. It exploits question-answering (QA) prompts for their open-ended nature, encouraging models to generate more nuanced responses than restrictive prompt types.\\n- The approach uses the LLM itself to recursively transform task inputs into effective QA formats, collecting several noisy votes for an input‚Äôs true label. These votes are then aggregated using weak supervision, a technique for combining noisy predictions without additional labeled data.\\n- AMA first recursively uses the LLM to reformat tasks and prompts to effective formats, and second aggregates the predictions across prompts using weak-supervision. The reformatting is performed using prompt-chains, which consist of functional\\n(fixed, reusable) prompts that operate over the varied task inputs. Here, given the input example, the prompt-chain includes a\\nquestion()-prompt through which the LLM converts the input claim to a question, and an answer() prompt, through which the\\nLLM answers the question it generated. Different prompt-chains (i.e., differing in the in-context question and answer demonstrations) lead to different predictions for the input‚Äôs true label.\\n\\n[Ask Me Anything: A Simple Strategy for Prompting Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02441)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/AMA.jpg)\\n\\n- AMA was evaluated across multiple open-source model families (EleutherAI, BLOOM, OPT, and T0) and sizes (125M-175B parameters), demonstrating an average performance improvement of 10.2% over a few-shot baseline. Remarkably, it enabled the GPT-J-6B model to match or exceed few-shot GPT-3-175B performance on 15 out of 20 popular benchmarks.\\n- The paper concludes that AMA not only facilitates the use of smaller, open-source LLMs by reducing the need for perfect prompting but also suggests a scalable and effective method for prompt aggregation.\\n- Code\\n\\n[Code](https://github.com/HazyResearch/ama_prompting)\\n## Promptbreeder\\n[Promptbreeder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16797)\\n- Proposed in Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement Via Prompt Evolution by Fernando et al. from Google DeepMind, Promptbreeder is an innovative system designed to evolve and adapt prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) autonomously, enhancing their reasoning capabilities across a range of tasks without manual prompt engineering. The system utilizes evolutionary algorithms to mutate a population of task-prompts and mutation-prompts generated by the LLM itself, demonstrating a unique self-referential improvement mechanism.\\n- Promptbreeder outperforms existing prompt strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks and proves its efficiency in evolving domain-specific prompts for complex tasks like hate speech classification, showcasing its adaptability and scalability.\\n- The evolution process features a diverse set of mutation operators, including direct mutation, estimation of distribution, hypermutation, Lamarckian mutation, and prompt crossover with context shuffling. These operators facilitate the exploration of a wide range of cognitive strategies and promote diversity in prompt evolution.\\n- The following figure from the paper shows an overview of Promptbreeder. Given a problem description and an initial set of general ‚Äúthinking-styles‚Äù and mutation-prompts, Promptbreeder generates a population of units of evolution, each unit consisting of typically two task-prompts and a mutation-prompt. We then run a standard binary tournament genetic algorithm (Harvey, 2011). To determine the fitness of a task-prompt we evaluate its performance on a random batch of training data. Over multiple generations, Promptbreeder subsequently mutates task-prompts as well as mutation-prompts using five different classes of mutation operators. The former leads to increasingly domain-adaptive task-prompts whereas the latter evolves increasingly useful mutation-prompts in a self-referential way.\\n\\n[Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement Via Prompt Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16797)\\n\\n![](../../../images/papers/Promptbreeder.jpg)\\n\\n- Experiments highlight Promptbreeder‚Äôs effectiveness in evolving intricate task-prompts that significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its potential to automate the generation of effective, domain-specific prompts for improving LLMs‚Äô performance across various tasks.\\n\\n## Visual Summary\\n- The following infographic from Aishwarya Naresh Reganti offers a visual summary of some of the most popular prompting techniques.\\n\\n[Aishwarya Naresh Reganti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areganti/)\\n\\n![](/primers/ai/assets/prompt/summary.jpg)\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n- Prompt Engineering Overview by Elvis Saravia\\n- Prompt Engineering Guide by Elvis Saravia\\n    \\nIt organizes all the best guides and resources in one single place.\\n\\n\\n- It organizes all the best guides and resources in one single place.\\n- Prompt Engineering Guide by Elvis Saravia\\n    \\nThe Prompt Engineering Guide is a project by DAIR.AI.\\n\\n\\n- The Prompt Engineering Guide is a project by DAIR.AI.\\n- Learn Prompting\\n\\nAn open-source course on prompt engineering.\\n\\n\\n- An open-source course on prompt engineering.\\n- OpenAI Cookbook\\n\\nA comprehensive repository consisting of prompt examples and guides.\\n\\n\\n- A comprehensive repository consisting of prompt examples and guides.\\n- Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Methods in Natural Language Processing\\n\\nA survey paper formally introducing prompt engineering.

Your task is to simplify the concepts discussed on this page and explain them in an easy-to-understand manner. For each prompting technique mentioned, provide clear, concise examples that illuminate how the same task would be approached differently.\n",
        "Personality and Tone: Adopt the role of a friendly and knowledgeable teacher who excels at breaking down complex subjects into easily digestible pieces. Your explanations should be patient and encouraging, aiming to enlighten without overwhelming. The tone should be casual yet informative, making technical content accessible to a broad audience, including beginners.\n",
        "Contextual Information: Assume the user has a basic understanding of AI but may not be familiar with advanced concepts of prompt engineering. Wherever possible, relate technical details to everyday scenarios or familiar contexts to enhance comprehension.\n",
