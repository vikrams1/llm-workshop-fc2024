    "## Components of an Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluations generally consist of four key elements:\n",
    "- An **input prompt** that serves as the basis for the model's completion. This prompt often includes a set of variable inputs that are inserted into a prompt template during testing.\n",
    "- The **output** generated by the model in response to the input prompt.\n",
    "- A **\"gold standard\" answer** used as a reference for assessing the model's output. This can be an exact match that the output must replicate, or an exemplary answer that provides a benchmark for grading.\n",
    "- A **score**, determined by one of the grading approaches outlined below, which indicates the model's performance on the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Grading Approaches\n",
    "Evaluations can be time-consuming and costly in two main areas: creating questions and gold standard answers, and the scoring/grading process itself.  \n",
    "Developing questions and ideal answers is often a one-time fixed cost, albeit potentially time-intensive if a suitable dataset is not readily available (consider leveraging an LLM to generate questions!). However, grading is a recurring expense incurred each time the evaluation is conducted, which is likely to be frequent. Therefore, designing evaluations that can be graded efficiently and economically should be a central priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://gist.github.com/assets/463317/e970bb03-9552-4712-ba12-727b89928e3b)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary methods for grading (scoring) evaluations:\n",
    "- **Programmatic grading:** This approach involves using standard code (primarily string matching and regular expressions) to assess the model's outputs. Common techniques include checking for an exact match against an answer or verifying the presence of key phrase(s) in a string. Programmatic grading is the most optimal method when feasible, as it is extremely fast and highly reliable. However, not all evaluations are amenable to this style of grading.\n",
    "- **Human in the loop:** In this approach, a human reviewer examines the model-generated answer, compares it to the gold standard, and assigns a score. While manual grading is the most versatile method, applicable to nearly any task, it is also exceptionally slow and costly, especially for large-scale evaluations. Designing evaluations that necessitate manual grading should be avoided whenever possible.\n",
    "- **Model-based grading:** LLMs (especially Claude, GPT-4) are really good at grading themselves (or even outputs of other LLMs) especially in wide range of tasks that traditionally needed human judgement like tone in creative writing or accuracy in open-ended question, or classification. This model-based grading is accomplished by creating a _grader prompt_ for an LLM\n",

    "\n",
    "### Weave evaluation concepts \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Model\n",
    "First, the model. In order to make your evaluation reproducible, Weave assists in tracking the code and configs and parameters of your LLM call under one \"Model\" object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Structuring your LLM calls in this way allows you to keep track of your experiements and code changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models are automatically versioned, giving you the option to compare two evaluations runs with different LLM calls, or different temperature parameters and compare apples to apples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Datasets\n",
    "Weave's strength comes from serialization and storage of datasets (backed by the very robust and scalable WandB artifacts platform). \n",
    "When you use hundreds of even thousands of prompts and examples, you can benefit from Weave's ability to track and version your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset is also versioned, and stored on our server, so you and your team can reuse the dataset across your pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Evaluation & Scoring (Grading)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluation class is designed to assess the performance of a Model on a given Dataset using \"scoring\" functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring can be programmatic or LLM as a judge\n",

    "- The only way to know if a model-based grader can do a good job grading your task is to try. Try it out and read some samples to see if your task is a good candidate.\n",
    "- Often all that lies between you and an automatable eval is clever design. Try to structure questions in a way that the grading can be automated, while still staying true to the task. Reformatting questions into multiple choice is a common tactic here.\n",
    "- In general, your preference should be for higher volume and lower quality of questions over very low volume with high quality."
